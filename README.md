# IoT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System
This project is to automate the irrigation process for agriculture which amounts for 70% of the income of India. Input for various reading from DHT11(temperature and humidity) and moisture sensor are passed on to the Arduino board which based on set values determines if the pump should be turned on or not. We can change the values for different crops as they need different conditions to grow and hence the field can be irrigated based on a new set of parameters suitable for that crop.
